## Key Concepts in Positioning El ements

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text.

You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too).

To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

## Containing Elements

If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.
It is common to group a number of elements together inside a < div >
(or other block-level) element.

For example, you might group together all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and the main navigation).
The < div> element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing element.

## How Controlling the Position of Elements ?

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning.
You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS.
You can also float elements using the float property.

To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.
