## controling sizes of images in css

 You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

## AligNi ng images Using css

Rather than using the < img > element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:

1. The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image

2. New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.

## Centering images Using css

By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel
element using the display property with a value of block.

Once it has been made into a block-level element, there are
two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:

1. On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
2. On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.
